LCD-Fixer
=========

Full screen window that either blinks multiple colors, or is blank white.  You can use this to try to fix stuck pixels or ghosting on LCD (or other?) screens.

The purpose of this application is to "fix" screens with ghosting by displaying a rapidly changing full screen of colors or a blank white screen.  

DISCLAIMER: I don't know anything about any screen technology (Plasmas, LCDs, CRTs or what have you), I just read on the Internet that this sometimes helps fix ghosting issues.  I am not responsible for any damage this does to your screen.

LICENSE: This application is without a license.  Do what you want with it, when you want to.  Just don't blame me when it doesn't do what you want, or damages your stuff.
